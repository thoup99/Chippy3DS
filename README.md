# Chippy3DS
Chippy3DS is a Chip-8 Emulator built specifically for the Nintendo 3DS.

# Demo
A demo video of the program running can be found [here](https://youtu.be/d48lGP5Azew). This footage was captured using the Citra 3DS Emulator.

Installation on 3DS
===================
A modded 3ds console is needed to run this program. If you 3ds is not already modded please follow the guide at https://3ds.hacks.guide/. Please do not follow video tutorials as many of them are outdated.

Remove the SD card from your 3DS while it is powered off and connect it to your computer. Locate the __`3ds`__ folder on the root of your SD card and drag and drop the __`Chippy3DS.3dsx`__ file into it. This file can be retrieved from the root of this projects github page.

Running on 3DS
===============
After completing the installation, turn on your 3DS and navigate to the homebrew launcher. Locate the Chippy3DS file and press __`A`__ to run it.

NOTICE
======
This is a demo version of the emulator that is not finished. Most Roms will run with perfection, but since there is no file browser built in yet, you will only be able to play whatever rom is baked into the Chippy3DS.3dsx file. Getting a file browser implimented is something that I would like to do in the near future so the emulator can be easier to use.
